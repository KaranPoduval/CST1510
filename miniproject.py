# ==================================================================== INPUT
# 1. Ask the user for your three values.
#
#    - the first is TEXT      (a name, a hostname, an IP)  -> no conversion needed
#    - the second is a NUMBER (use float(), not int())
#    - the third  is a NUMBER (use float(), not int())
#
#    Remember: input() always gives back text.
#| **Cyber Security** | source IP, failed logins, total attempts | `10.0.0.5`, `12`, `400` |

# label = input("source IP:")      # : replace with an input() call
# failed_logins = float(input("failed logins:"))     # : replace with an input() call, converted
# attempts = float(input("total attempts:"))   # : replace with an input() call, converted

label = "10.0.0.5"     # : replace with an input() call
failed_logins = float(12)     # : replace with an input() call, converted
attempts = float(400)
# ================================================================== PROCESS
# 2. Work out what you were NOT given.       [Typical and above]
#
#    - difference : how far the first is from the second
#    - percent    : the first as a percentage of the second
#
#    Do not type the answers. Calculate them.

difference = (attempts - failed_logins)   # 
percent = (failed_logins/attempts)*100     # 


# =================================================================== OUTPUT
# 3. Print the report.
#
#    Threshold : print the three values you were given, inside a border
#    Typical   : add difference and percent, 2 decimal places, right-aligned
#    Excellent : difference always shows its sign, plus one line of your own
#
#    Useful:   f"{value:>10.2f}"    right-aligned, 2 decimal places
#              f"{value:>+10.2f}"   the same, but always shows the sign

print()
print("=" * 34)
print(f"  RECORD CHECK  -  {label}")

print("  Name : Karan")
print("  Lane : Cyber")
print("  Date : 09/23/26")

# ==========================================================================
# 4. Before you finish:
#
#    [ ] Run it three times with different numbers
#    [ ] Run it with a total of 0 and write the error in your journal
#    [ ] Check every variable name says what it holds
#    [ ] Show it to the person next to you
